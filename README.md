### **Task 2 – Predictive Modeling & Hypothesis Testing**

**Project:** Insurance Risk Analysis & Predictive Modeling
**Organization:** AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS)
**Branch:** task-2
**Author:** Newaz Nezif
**Date:** 12/5/2025

**Project Overview:**
Task 2 focused on building predictive models for insurance claims and premiums, along with conducting statistical hypothesis testing to validate risk factors identified during Task 1. This helped in estimating expected claims and optimizing premium pricing for different customer segments.

**Objectives:**

* Conduct hypothesis testing to confirm relationships between features and TotalClaims
* Engineer relevant features for predictive modeling
* Build regression and classification models for predicting claims and premium optimization
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R²

**Data Source:**

* Cleaned and preprocessed dataset from Task 1
* Relevant features selected based on EDA insights

**Progress – Task 2 Completed:**

* Hypotheses tested using statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square)
* Feature engineering performed: encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features
* Regression models built to predict TotalClaims and expected premium
* Model performance evaluated, results visualized and interpreted
* Notebook `Hypothesis_Tests.ipynb` documents testing results and conclusions
* Modeling notebook `Modeling.ipynb` includes predictive analysis workflows

**Key Insights from Task 2:**

* Gender, VehicleType, and Province significantly influence TotalClaims
* Certain vehicle makes and models consistently exhibit higher risk
* Regression models show acceptable predictive performance for premium estimation
* Insights from hypothesis tests support strategic premium adjustments for low- and high-risk segments

**Pending / Next Steps:**

* Refine models for deployment (Task 3)
* Integrate insights into company dashboards for business use
